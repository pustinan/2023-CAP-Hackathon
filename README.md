# 2023-CAP-Hackathon
Welcome to my solution for the 2023 CAP SAC Hackathon! The problem involves solving a set of differential equations to model the re-entry trajectory of a space probe. We can use the provided equations and numerical methods to solve the system of equations. My code is a Python program using the 'scipy' library for numerical integration, more specifically, the 'odeint' function. 
You can adjust the initial conditions, time points, and the parameter Î» based on your specific problem requirements. 
The resulting plot shows the Altitude Profile of the Re-Entry trajectory over Time.
